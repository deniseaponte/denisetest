how am i supposed to code this?
ok, so why is this not pushing to github.com?
  that's because you must first add, then commit before you push
let me try one more time to push
ok, i think i'm getting the hang of this...sorta
trying again to add, commit and push to denisetest repository on github.com 
i have to practice this some more because i'm really not sure how i came to this point in the practice

that's actually some pretty cool stuff man
